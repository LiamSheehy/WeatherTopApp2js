# WeatherTopApp2
This is my web and programming assignment Weather Top App 2 release 1+

I have completed the items to release 1 plus singular elements from other releases (lt&lng, station deletion)
The Stations and readings appear as expected and are access via the dashboard access panel
The latest readings are displaying in the station view, struggled to replicate to the list stations view.
There are icons displaying on each parameter along with the required calcs up to release 1
I did include single elements for 2 & 3 i.e. Lat & longitude, ability to delete both stations and readings
I have set up sign up and user login with the previous items loading correctly per user.
